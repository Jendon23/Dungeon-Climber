A multiplayer VR adventure game inspired by The Legend of Zelda series, as well as Super Mario 64 and its successors. Players are able to interact in a physics based environment using the HTC Vive's room scale controls, including being able to push or pick up each other, while battling enemies and solving environmental puzzles.
Originally a project final during a college course. Dungeon Climber was continued after graduation in a semi-professional team environment. Since many portions of the game were created by other team members, only a majority of the game's code can be uploaded.
